# DAW2-PROIEKTUA

This repository contains the final project developed as part of the **Web Application Development 2 (DAW2)** course. The objective of the project is to build a complete application with a clear separation between frontend, backend, and data management.

## 📌 Project Overview

The project consists of a **library management mobile application**. It allows users to interact with book-related data through a web interface that communicates with a backend API.

The application is structured into different modules to ensure maintainability and scalability:
- A backend **API** responsible for data access and business logic.
- A frontend application that consumes the API.
- A database layer to store and manage information.

This project was developed for academic purposes and focuses on applying software development concepts and best practices.

## 💻 Technologies Used

The project uses a combination of technologies commonly found in software development:

- **Node.js** for backend/API development
- **Flutter & Dart** for frontend development
- Modular folder structure to separate concerns (API, frontend, database)
